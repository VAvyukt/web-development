        Hi! My name is Vivaan Agrawal, and I'm so happy that you are here! The purpose of this webpage is to tell you things about myself. I love to learn and some of my favorite subjects in school are math, science, and history. Some of my hobbies are music, art, and reading. I used to play the French Horn in my school band, and I was really good at it. I really like to play Table Tennis and I am a black belt in taekwondo. Hope you enjoyed my webpage! Keep checking my future pages for improvements in my coding. Bye! See you next time!
