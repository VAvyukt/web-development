        <p style="color:#7DBEED">
            My name is Vivaan Agrawal, and I am in 8th grade. I love coding in various languages, such 
            as Java, Python, HTML, etc. I also love learning, but I especially like math and science.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color:#02968C">My Wish</h2>
        <p style="color:#7DBEED">
            My wish is to perfect my coding skills in this class and outside of this class. I want to 
            ensure that I know how to code expertly in all of the languages mentioned above. I also 
            want to learn about CSS and JavaScript, so that my front-end (website) coding is the best 
            that it can be.
