        <div><h1>More About Who We Are and What We Do</h1>
        <p>An "AvGeek," or aviation geek, is an individual with a deep, passionate enthusiasm for all aspects of aviation, far beyond the interest of a casual traveler. This community is united by a love for aircraft and the complex systems of flight, which they express through a wide range of activities. These can include plane spotting at airports to photograph and log different aircraft, meticulously building and flying on flight simulators, using apps to track flights in real-time around the globe, visiting airshows and museums, and memorizing technical details like aircraft types, engine models, and airport codes. Whether they are pilots, engineers, aviation historians, or simply devoted hobbyists, AvGeeks share a common fascination with the engineering, logistics, and sheer wonder of human flight.</p></div>
